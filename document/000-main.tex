\section{Closing thoughts}%
\label{sec:final-remarks}

We have analyzed the convergence and accuracy of 3 different algorithms and how
it relates with the value of the regularization parameter $\lambda$. We have also
seen the effect of the size of the training set on the execution time and that
$SGM$ is the best algorithm in terms of accuracy and convergence for larger datasets.

However, there are additional parameters that we have not considered, for instance
the line searching algorithm, the Wolfe conditions or the various parameters of
$SGM$. Additionally, we only performed a single run for each algorithm and combination
of parameters, so to draw more robust conclusions we would need to perform multiple
runs with different seeds and average the results.

It may be interesting to do a grid search over a larger range of parameters and
see how the results change.

\section{References}

I used MATLAB~\cite{noauthor_matlab_2022} for the simulations and algorithms.
For the analysis of the
results and the plots I used Julia~\cite{bezanson_julia_2017}
and its excellent packages for plotting~\cite{breloff_plotsjl_2022,plas_fonspplutojl_2022,carlsson_pgfplotsxjl_2022}.

Below is a list of the software and the most relevant packages used in this
project. There are also the two chapters of the book on Numerical Optimization~\cite{nocedal_line_2006,nocedal_quasi-newton_2006} which I
used as reference along with the course materials.
