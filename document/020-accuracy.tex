\section{Study of Accuracy}

We'll study the accuracy of the three algorithms. To do so, we
repeat the experiments of \cref{sec:convergence} but this time
we'll use a more realistic dataset, generated from the following
parameters:
\begin{center}
    \begin{BVerbatim}
    tr_p = 20000; te_q = tr_p/10; tr_freq = 0.0;
    \end{BVerbatim}
\end{center}

We'll use the values of $\lambda$ that gave the best accuracy in
the experiments from~\cref{sec:convergence} for each algorithm.
These previous results are shown in~\cref{tab:te_acc_250}.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \caption{Accuracy on test set from previous experiment (\texttt{tr\_p = 250}) with
    the highest average accuracy for each method highlighted}%
    \label{tab:te_acc_250}%
    \input{table_te_acc_250}
\end{table}
